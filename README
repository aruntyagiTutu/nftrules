How to run this project
go to workspace and run command flask run

How to hit buy api
go to sample_requests.http file and click send request, api exposed over http

what this code is covering

scenario 1:
when user is buying, system will place order and if order placed successfully it will add event to the queue to run rules on the data

Here I used in-memory queue to add event, one worker is continuously reading this queue and checking given condition and taking actions
In real system
I will use Pub-Sub, events will be published and rules subscriber will read event and add event to further appropriate queue/streaming service

Here I used hard coded three condition
In real system I will use dynamic condition from rules Data:
Create query like
data[rule.property] is rule.condition rule.value
rule.operator(and, or)
...

then rule.action

Scenario 2:

Send notification to user 7 days after listing of NFT

If this time is fixed I will use similar logic where one worker will fetch users data as per condition and send them notification in appropriate time as per there location 

Scenario 3:
Send notification on basis of elapsed time after action,
 for this I used priority queue here, 
 In real system I will used service like Azure service Bus which will push event into queue with time to execute as param.
 this will be scalable solution.
